This is a final project developed for CSCI-220 Data Structures. 
Our team has developed a AVL Tree for a word dictionary. 
It uses this tree in a menu enviorment, where the user can insert/search/delete nodes.
Also this project features a benchmark that tests the AVL tree alongside of Python's dictionary.
